## What are JavaScript and EcmaScript? ðŸ”¹

  ECMAScript is a programming language itself, specified in the document ECMA-262. In other words, ECMA-262 is the specification of     the programming language ECMAScript.
  JavaScript, on the other hand, can be viewed as a "dialect" of ECMAScript. It conforms to the ECMAScript specification while also     providing additional features not described in the specification.
  JavaScript also is an interpreted language, not a compiled language and it's syntax is heavily inspired by C++ and Java.
  
## Writing a JavaScript program ðŸ”¹

  JavaScript programs can either be placed directly into the HTML file (BAD PRACTICE) or they can be saved in external files (GOOD       PRACTICE).

## Variables ðŸ”¹

 JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.
 
 Two steps required in order to use a variables:
 
  * Declaration (Declaring a variable)
  
  * Initialization (Giving the variable a value)
 
 The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
 
* Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.

* Names must begin with a letter

* Names can also begin with $ and _

* Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)

* Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

## Primitive Data Types in JavaScript ðŸ”¹

* String
* Number
* Boolean
* Undefined
* Null

## Null VS Undefined ðŸ”¹

In JavaScript, undefined is a type, whereas null an object.

Undefined means a variable is declared, but no value has been assigned to it (The variable is declared, but not defined).

Null in JavaScript is an assignment value (It means nothing for the moment). You can assign it to a variable.
